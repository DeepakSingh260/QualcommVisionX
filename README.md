# VigiCar: AI-Powered Vehicle Intrusion Detection System

## Project Overview

VigiCar is an innovative AI-driven system designed to detect and prevent vehicle theft attempts using advanced computer vision techniques. By leveraging state-of-the-art object detection and action recognition models, VigiCar aims to provide real-time surveillance and alerts for suspicious activities around parked vehicles.

## Roadmap

### 1. Dataset Development

- [ ] Collect diverse surveillance footage of simulated car theft attempts
- [ ] Include various scenarios: keying, window breaking, door forcing, etc.
- [ ] Capture data in different environments: parking lots, streets, driveways
- [ ] Ensure variety in lighting conditions, weather, and camera angles
- [ ] Annotate dataset with bounding boxes and action labels

### 2. Model Architecture

- [ ] Implement Faster R-CNN architecture
- [ ] Integrate ResNet-50 backbone with Feature Pyramid Network
- [ ] Develop custom layers for action recognition

### 3. Training Pipeline

- [ ] Set up data preprocessing and augmentation pipeline
- [ ] Implement two-stage training procedure for Faster R-CNN
- [ ] Develop custom loss functions for object detection and action classification
- [ ] Create evaluation scripts for model performance metrics

### 4. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Conduct cross-validation on training data
- [ ] Evaluate model on held-out test set
- [ ] Perform real-world testing in controlled parking scenarios

### 5. Optimization

- [ ] Implement non-maximum suppression for overlapping detections
- [ ] Optimize model for edge deployment (quantization, pruning)
- [ ] Enhance inference speed for real-time processing

### 6. Integration and Deployment

- [ ] Develop user interface for security personnel
- [ ] Create mobile app for vehicle owner alerts
- [ ] Establish protocols for integration with existing security systems

### 7. Documentation and Reporting

- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for system architecture and usage
- [ ] Prepare performance reports and analysis
- [ ] Create user manuals for different stakeholders
